# Login and Registration System in C++
This repository contains a simple console-based login and registration system implemented in C++. It demonstrates basic file handling, user input, and authentication mechanisms.

# Features
User Registration: Users can register by providing a username and password. The credentials are stored in a file named users.txt.
User Login: Registered users can log in by providing their credentials, which are validated against the stored data.
Menu Interface: A simple text-based menu allows users to choose between registration, login, and exiting the program.

Upon running the program, users are greeted with a welcome message and a menu offering three options:
1. Register
2. Login
3. Quit
