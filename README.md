# Login-Demo
This is a simple console-based login and registration system in C++. It allows users to register by providing a username and password, which are then saved to a file, and to log in using previously registered credentials.
This system provides a basic foundation for understanding user authentication in a C++ console application. However, for production use, significant enhancements would be needed to improve security and functionality.
